And finally, I found Hugo!\nVery useful Setup, first #How to setup is different with each OS. One thing to note, you NEED to install Hugo Extended version, not just Hugo. Detailed information for installation is here, so check your installation method.\nNext, setup your directory. you have to do is type this to console.\nhugo new site homepage Yeah it is very easy. You can change homepage part to what you want for folder name.\nAs I mentioned, Hugo has lots of templates. Till you will use github pages, let\u0026rsquo;s set up git. So, type this\ncd homepage git init And all things will be OK. and you need to upload your project on github with\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026#34;initialize\u0026#34; git remote add origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo-name\u0026gt;.git git push origin master I think VSCode is much easier than CLI by the way.\nAnyway, This site\u0026rsquo;s theme is Congo. I tried some themes and this was the best.\nEasy to make good layout You will add theme with git\u0026rsquo;s submodule usually, but Congo has original way to install. So check own installation when you try another themes.\nYou can install Congo theme with command below.\nhugo mod init github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo-name\u0026gt; In addition, make config/_default/module.toml file and write text below.\n[[imports]] path = \u0026#34;github.com/jpanther/congo/v2\u0026#34; At last, this.\nhugo server With this command, you can make your website on Localhost server. On first run, hugo will automatically download and install files what you need for theme set on imports. So, run your server instantly when you finished setup.\nThis is all the way to setup your website.\nOther settings #If you use github pages for publish, it is useful that hugo\u0026rsquo;s build settings on docs folder. So, write on \u0026lt;directory\u0026gt;/hugo.toml that\npublishDir = \u0026#34;docs\u0026#34; This setting will change hugo to generate html files on \u0026lt;directory\u0026gt;/docs/ when you run server.\nIn addition, you can add language settings by yourself. Initial setting is English, so if you wanna add Japanese, you have to make languages.ja.toml under config/, and write information as well.\nThese settings is explained very clear on Congo docs. Here it is.\nConclusion #Making website is very high level. But now, we have many useful tools. So let\u0026rsquo;s make your own website!\n","date":null,"permalink":"/homepage/en/posts/20241217-hugo/","section":"","summary":"About creation of this pages","title":"Hugo - very useful"},{"content":"About #","date":null,"permalink":"/homepage/en/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":""},{"content":"Works #","date":null,"permalink":"/homepage/en/works/","section":"","summary":"","title":""},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/homepage/en/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/homepage/en/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
